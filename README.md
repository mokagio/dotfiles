# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, in the hope to simplify the transiction to any new machine.

## Install

1. The starting point is Xcode, and it's Command Line Tools
2. You'll now have `git`, use it to clone this repo
2. [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), to install basically all the rest
3. [Brewdler](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-brewdler), to install all the other tools and apps
4. Run the `setup.sh` script, which will symlink all the dotfiles to `$HOME`
