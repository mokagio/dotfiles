# Use with extreme caution!
# Only ignore files such as vim's *.swp or OS X's .DS_Store, which are system specific
# Never ignore files that are specific to a project or framework in here! That's what the repo's gitignore is for!

.DS_Store

# Xcode's DerivedData
# The derived data folder location is a user setting, so it seems ok to add it
# to the global gitignore.
